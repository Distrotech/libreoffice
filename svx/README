For SdrObjects, there are own DrawingLayer primitives in
svx/source/sdr/primitive2d

The ViewContact / ViewObject / ViewObjectContact are in svx/source/sdr/contact
Decomposes the SdrObjects, and does all sort of operations on them.

[So far I haven't found a definition / concept what are supposed to be the
ViewContact / ViewObject / ViewObjectContact.  If you find that out, please
fix this README :-)]
