UNO bindings for the Python programming language.

To have much joy debugging python extensions you need to:
  a) edit pythonloader.py in your install setting DEBUG=1 at the top
  b) touch pyuno/source/module/pyuno_runtime.cxx and 'make debug=true' in pyuno

Then you'll start to see your exceptions on the console instead of them getting
lost at the UNO interface.
