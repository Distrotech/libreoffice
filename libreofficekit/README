LibreOfficeKit
**************

LibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality
through C/C++, without any need to use UNO.

For now it only offers document conversion (in addition to an experimental
tiled rendering API).

Integrating LOK into other software
-----------------------------------

LOK functionality can be accessed by including LibreOfficeKit.h[xx] in your
program.

LOK initialisation (lok_init) requires the inclusion of LibreOfficeKitInit.h
in your program. Should you be using the C++ LibreOfficeKit.hxx header you
must first include LibreOfficeKitInit.h followed by LibreOfficeKit.hxx in any
files where you need to use lok_cpp_init.

(LibreOfficeKit.hxx is a simple and fully inlined C++ wrapper for the same
functionality as in LibreOfficeKit.h.)

An example program (currently using the older shim.c/static library
integration) can be seen on:

Tiled Rendering
---------------

To use LOK Tiled Rendering you will need the following before the LOK includes:
#define LOK_USE_UNSTABLE_API

(This must be define before ANY LOK header, i.e. including the Init header.)

Currently only bitmap-buffer rendering is supported, with a 32-bit RGBA
colourspace (further alternatives could feasibly be implemented as needed).
Scanlines are ordered top-down (whereas LibreOffice will internally default
to bottom-up).

LibreOfficeKitGtk
*****************

Currently consists of only a very basic GTK+ document viewer widget.

Currently this simply renders the entire document as one large tile (for
Writer) and/or entire sheet for Calc, which can be somewhat slow with
larger documents.
